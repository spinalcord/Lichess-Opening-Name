# Lichess-Opening-Name
An extension for Google Chrome. This extension displays you the current opening name on lichess.com, durring the game.
Make sure you have developer mode enabled in google chrome. I also recommend you to use this plugin against bots and stockfish and not against users. The raw list can be found [here](https://www.jimmyvermeer.com/openings.html).
